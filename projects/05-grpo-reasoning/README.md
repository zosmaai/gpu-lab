# Project 05: GRPO Reasoning Training

Teaching Qwen3.5-0.8B to reason using **GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization)** — the RL technique behind DeepSeek-R1 — with verifiable math rewards on a single RTX 5090.

**Model:** [celestialcreator/Qwen3.5-0.8B-GRPO-Math](https://huggingface.co/celestialcreator/Qwen3.5-0.8B-GRPO-Math)
**Dataset:** [celestialcreator/Qwen3.5-0.8B-GRPO-Math-Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/celestialcreator/Qwen3.5-0.8B-GRPO-Math-Dataset)

## Results

| Model | GSM8K 8-shot CoT | GSM8K Zero-shot | Notes |
|-------|:-----------------:|:---------------:|-------|
| Qwen3.5-0.8B (baseline) | 53.5% | 52.1% | Pre-trained model, no fine-tuning |
| + SFT only | not evaluated | not evaluated | Teaches `<think>` format (see Lessons below) |
| **+ SFT + GRPO (ours)** | 50.4% (-3.1pp) | **58.0% (+5.9pp)** | Internalized reasoning ability |
| + SFT + GRPO (8-shot `<think>` aligned) | 34.1% (-19.4pp) | — | Format-aligned few-shot hurts even more |

### Key Finding: Demonstration → Policy Shift

GRPO training shifted the model from **demonstration-based reasoning** (learns from examples) to **policy-based reasoning** (has its own internal reasoning strategy).

After training, the model:
- **Performs best in zero-shot** — it reasons autonomously using `<think>` tags
- **Is hurt by few-shot examples** — any demonstrations conflict with its learned policy
- **Is hurt even more by format-aligned few-shot** — `<think>` tags in examples caused the model to confuse context with generation, dropping to 34.1%

This is a behavioral shift, not a regression. The model no longer needs (or wants) demonstrations.

> **Note:** We did not evaluate the SFT-only checkpoint separately, so we cannot isolate SFT's contribution from GRPO's. See [Lessons Learned](#lessons-learned) for honest analysis.

## Overview

GRPO eliminates the need for a separate reward model and critic network (unlike PPO). For each prompt, it:
1. Samples G completions from the policy
2. Scores each with a verifiable reward (exact math answer checking)
3. Normalizes rewards within the group (relative advantage)
4. Updates the policy using a clipped surrogate objective

Only 2 models in memory (policy + reference) instead of 4, making it feasible on consumer GPUs.

## Training Pipeline

### Phase 1: SFT Warmup
- **Data:** 3,558 reasoning examples from 3 sources, standardized to `<think>` tags
  - 1,000 Claude Sonnet-generated math reasoning chains (originally `<thought>` tags, converted to `<think>` by `merge_sft_data.py`)
  - ~250 from TeichAI/claude-4.5-opus-high-reasoning-250x (already `<think>` format)
  - ~2,300 from nohurry/Opus-4.6-Reasoning-3000x-filtered (separate thinking/solution fields, combined into `<think>` format)
- **Purpose:** Teach the model `<think>` tag format before RL — solves the cold-start problem where a 0.8B model can't discover reasoning patterns via pure RL exploration
- **Stats:** 1 epoch, loss 0.932, 78% token accuracy
- **Caveat:** We did not eval this checkpoint separately — see [Lessons Learned](#lessons-learned)

### Phase 2: GRPO Training
- **Data:** GSM8K train split (7,473 math word problems)
- **Rewards:** Math correctness (1.0/0.0) + format reward (0.3 for `<think>` tags, 0.2 for `####` answer)
- **Config:** 8 generations/prompt, batch size 1 x 8 grad accum, lr 1e-6, beta 0.04
- **Hardware:** Single NVIDIA RTX 5090 (32GB VRAM)
- **Duration:** ~77 hours, stopped at epoch 2.13 after power cut (checkpoint-15900, rewards had plateaued)

## Quick Start

### 1. Set up secrets
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your HF_TOKEN, WANDB_API_KEY, GPU_UUID
```

### 2. Build Docker image
```bash
docker build -t localhost:5000/grpo-reasoning:latest -f Dockerfile.grpo .
docker push localhost:5000/grpo-reasoning:latest
```

### 3. Generate SFT data (optional — uses Claude API)
```bash
source .env
python3 scripts/generate_sft_data.py --num_examples 1000
python3 scripts/merge_sft_data.py
```

### 4. Run training (SFT + GRPO)
```bash
./apply.sh k8s/job-grpo-train.yaml
kubectl logs -f job/grpo-train
```

### 5. Evaluate
```bash
./apply.sh k8s/job-grpo-eval.yaml
kubectl logs -f job/grpo-eval
```

### 6. Monitor training
```bash
./scripts/monitor.sh 300  # check every 5 minutes with desktop notifications
```

## Lessons Learned

### What worked
- **GRPO improved zero-shot reasoning** — +5.9pp on GSM8K zero-shot, showing the model internalized step-by-step thinking
- **Format + correctness rewards together** — the 0.3 bonus for `<think>` tags + 0.2 for `####` format helped the model learn structured reasoning alongside math accuracy
- **Single consumer GPU is viable** — full SFT + GRPO pipeline ran on one RTX 5090 with room to spare (~10-12 GB used out of 32 GB)
- **Demonstration → Policy shift** — GRPO fundamentally changed how the model reasons. It shifted from relying on few-shot demonstrations to having its own internal reasoning policy. This is exactly what DeepSeek-R1 demonstrated at scale.

### What we'd do differently
- **Eval after SFT** — We skipped evaluating the SFT-only checkpoint. Without this, we can't tell if SFT helped or hurt baseline performance before GRPO. In hindsight, this is a critical missing data point. If SFT already degraded 8-shot performance (by overwriting the model's few-shot ability with `<think>` format), then the 8-shot drop may be from SFT, not GRPO.
- **Try GRPO without SFT** — An ablation comparing "base → GRPO" vs "base → SFT → GRPO" would show if SFT warmup is truly necessary at 0.8B scale, or if it's an unnecessary step that trades few-shot ability for format compliance.
- **Larger model** — 0.8B is near the capacity ceiling. The model learned the format but had limited headroom to improve math accuracy. DeepSeek-R1 used 670B; the smallest successful open reproductions start at 1.5B+.

### Technical findings
- **Qwen3.5-0.8B uses DeltaNet** (hybrid Gated DeltaNet + Gated Attention). Install `flash-linear-attention` + `causal-conv1d` for fast generation — without FLA, torch fallback is ~10x slower.
- **SDPA is faster than FLA for inference** (3.6x on first call). Use `attn_implementation="sdpa"` for eval.
- **Zero-shot is the right eval for RL-trained reasoning models** — few-shot examples conflict with learned `<think>` tag patterns, making 8-shot an unfair comparison. Even format-aligned `<think>` few-shot examples made things worse (34.1%), suggesting the model confuses example `<think>` tags with its own generation context.
- **Rewards plateau around epoch 1.2** — math_reward stabilized at ~0.45-0.53, suggesting diminishing returns beyond 2 epochs for this model size.
